                    <h4>Key Principles of Our Investor Charter
                    </h4>
                    <p>Transparency We will give timely, accurate, and transparent information on finance to our
                        investors so that they are thoroughly updated about their investments' performance.
                    </p>
                    <p>Accountability AS Research Technic will ensure proper corporate governance standards. The
                        institute is accountable to its investors and strives for the best interest of investors in
                        everything that's done.
                    </p>
                    <p><b> Fairness:</b>All investors are treated alike, and the same rights and opportunities are
                        afforded to all through applicable laws and regulations.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Risk Management </b>We are committed to the proactive management of risk as well as the
                        protection of invested capital. Investment risks are communicated to the investor.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We keep our investors on the informed pipeline with regular updates such as financial
                        statements, progress reports, and other relevant business developments in tandem with our
                        company's performance.

                        By following these principles, AS Research Technic will strive to establish trust and a strong
                        partnership with its investors that will usher in sustained growth and success.
