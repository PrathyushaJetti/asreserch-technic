                        <h3 class="text-anime-style-3">What is Delivery Cash Calls? </h3>




                        <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.25s">
                            Delivery Cash Calls are requests made by brokerage firms to their clients for funds required
                            to settle transactions where actual delivery of shares or securities is involved. When an
                            investor buys shares intending to take delivery, they need to pay the full purchase amount.
                            If sufficient funds are not available in the trading account, the broker may issue a
                            delivery cash call. This ensures that the client fulfils their financial obligation before
                            the settlement date. It is a critical aspect of maintaining transparency and smooth
                            operations in stock trading, safeguarding both the investor’s and the broker’s interests.
