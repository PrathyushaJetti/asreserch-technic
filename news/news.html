							<h2><a href="#"> Custom duty on critical minerals budget 2024 </a></h2>                            
                            <p>Our Finance minister proposes to exempt customs duty on 25 critical minerals in budget 2024. Our country India is heavily dependent on imports for most of the critical minerals, with a few exceptions like copper, gallium, cadmium, phosphorus, graphite, potash, titanium.
                                Our minister said on July 23 the budget also proposes to reduce basic customs duty on two such minerals but did not name them. The move is expected to give a major flip to processing and refining of such minerals and help secure their availability.
                                As of December 2023, India had a 5 – 10 percent on custom duty on critical minerals. Our country India has been actively pursuing international collaborations to enhance its critical minerals supply chain. Partnerships with countries such as Australia, known for its rich mineral resources, and participation in framework such as mineral security partnership are part of this strategy

                                 </a></h2>                            
                            <p>The Indian stock market saw a significant boost as the Sensex surged 550 points, reaching new highs for the year, and the Nifty climbed above 24,150. This surge was driven by favorable global and domestic factors. Positive momentum in Asian markets and a reassessment of U.S. recession risks led investors to focus on better economic signals, increasing buying in Indian equities. Domestically, the government’s easing of property tax regulations provided a boost to the real estate sector, stimulating investment and economic activity. This relaxation led to significant gains in real estate stocks, contributing to the overall market rally. The Sensex’s impressive 550-point rise and the Nifty crossing 24,150 underscore growing investor optimism about India’s economic outlook and corporate earnings potential, reflecting the strength and resilience of the Indian financial markets amid evolving conditions.

                            <p>On Thursday, gold prices remained steady at Rs 71,350 per 10 grams for 99.9% purity and Rs 71,000 per 10 grams for 99.5% purity, as reported by the All India Sarafa Association. In contrast, silver prices fell significantly by Rs 1,100 per kilogram to Rs 81,100, down from Rs 82,200 the previous day. This decline is attributed to reduced demand from coin manufacturers and industrial users. Internationally, gold was trading at USD 2,396 per ounce on Come, up by USD 3, reflecting increased investor interest in safe-haven assets due to geopolitical tensions and a weaker dollar index. Lower US Treasury yields also support gold prices. Silver was stable at USD 26.89 per ounce globally. Praveen Singh from Share khan by BNP Paribas noted that upcoming US jobless claims data, the Consumer Price Index for July, and the September nonfarm payrolls report could introduce market volatility and impact future interest rate decisions.

Brent crude futures climbed by 23 cents, or 0.3%, to $78.56 per barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude advanced by 29 cents, or 0.4%, to $75.52 per barrel. This rise followed a significant reduction in U.S. crude inventories, which has fallen by 3.7 million barrels to 429.3 million barrels—dramatically surpassing the forecasted 700,000-barrel drop.
                                U.S. Energy Information Administration data also revealed a sharp rise in production, hitting a record 13.4 million barrels per day. However, markets remain concerned about potential Middle East supply disruptions, particularly after recent violence involving militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah, which has heightened fears of possible retaliatory actions by Iran against Israel.

                            <p> China's yuan surged to a seven-month high against the dollar on Monday, bolstered by a stronger Japanese yen and a significant unwinding of emerging market carries trades. The onshore yuan hit 7.1150 per dollar in early trading, it’s highest since January 2, and was trading at 7.1365 by 0400 GMT, up 0.48% from Friday's close. The offshore yuan mirrored this trend, reaching 7.1123 before settling at 7.1317 around midday.
                                This rally was amplified by recent U.S. economic data, which intensified the bond rally post-FOMC meeting, creating a clear risk-on/risk-off scenario. Higher-beta currencies and favored positions lagged, while funding currencies rebounded notably. Analysts at Barclays highlighted that the yuan also gained additional support from the Bank of Japan's recent hawkish interest rate hike. As the People's Bank of China (PBOC) set the midpoint rate at 7.1345 per dollar, 567 pips stronger than Reuters' estimate, reflecting the yuan’s resilience amid shifting global dynamics.

                            <p>The U.S. dollar recently hit its lowest point in 2023 against the euro, driven by a confluence of economic factors and market uncertainties. Anticipation surrounding revisions to upcoming U.S. payrolls data and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's imminent speech have heightened market volatility. As bond yields decline and weak job statistics emerge, fears of an economic downturn are growing. These concerns are prompting investors to speculate about potential interest rate cuts as soon as next month. The dollar's depreciation reflects broader anxieties about the health of the U.S. economy and the Fed's future policy direction. With recession risks intensifying, the markets are keenly focused on Powell’s address for clues on the Fed's strategy, which could further influence both currency movements and investor sentiment in the weeks ahead. The evolving economic landscape underscores the delicate balance the Fed must navigate in steering the economy through turbulent times.
